# Project 01: Role-Based Access Control
# CyberPreacher Edition

## Project scenario

A small startup recently migrated its infrastructure to the Azure cloud. However, they didnâ€™t configure proper security controls. As a result:

- A developer accidentally exposed sensitive data stored in an S3 bucket (AWS) or Cloud Storage (GCP) to the public.
- An attacker gained access to the cloud environment using stolen credentials because MFA was not enabled.
- The company incurred unexpected costs due to unauthorized resource usage, as there were no billing alerts or monitoring in place.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.
