# Project 01: Role-Based Access Control
# CyberPreacher Edition

## Project scenario

A small startup recently migrated its infrastructure to the Azure cloud. However, they didnâ€™t configure proper security controls. As a result:

- A developer accidentally exposed sensitive data stored in an S3 bucket (AWS) or Cloud Storage (GCP) to the public.
- An attacker gained access to the cloud environment using stolen credentials because MFA was not enabled.
- The company incurred unexpected costs due to unauthorized resource usage, as there were no billing alerts or monitoring in place.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:

- Exercise 1: Create a Resource Group.

- Exercise 4: Enable Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- Exercise 5: Set Up Cost Alerts.

 >**Side Task**: Create a virtual machine, and assign **Bob** the Virtual machine contributor role for the machine. Then Log in as Bob and see what task **Bob** can perform with that role. Once done, take a screenshot of the completed task and upload on LinkedIn including the Hashtag #cloudprojectwithcyberpreacher while sharing your experiences around the project.
