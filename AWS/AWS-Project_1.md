### AWS Project 01: Role-Based Access Control
## CyberPreacher Edition

## Project Scenario
A small startup recently migrated its infrastructure to AWS. However, they didnâ€™t configure proper security controls. As a result:
- A developer accidentally exposed sensitive data stored in an S3 bucket to the public.
- An attacker gained access to the cloud environment using stolen credentials because MFA was not enabled.
- The company incurred unexpected costs due to unauthorized resource usage, as there were no billing alerts or monitoring in place.

> For all the resources in this lab, use the **US East (N. Virginia)** region.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:
- Exercise 1: Create a Resource Group.
- Exercise 2: Create an AWS IAM User and assign the Security Administrator role.
- Exercise 3: Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the Resource Group.
- Exercise 4: Enable AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
- Exercise 5: Set Up Cost Alerts.

### Summary of Key Security Practices

- **IAM**: Use least privilege principles for IAM roles and policies.
- **Logging**: Enable logging and monitoring.

> **Side Task**: Create an EC2 instance and assign **Bob** the **EC2InstanceAdministrator** role for the instance. Then log in as Bob and see what tasks **Bob** can perform with that role. Once done, take a screenshot of the completed task and upload it on LinkedIn with the hashtag #cloudprojectwithcyberpreacher while sharing your experiences around the project.

> **Note**: Ensure to delete all resources created during this project to manage costs.
